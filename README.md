# Last assignment for the design part of AppII

We are almost finish with the course Application Developement II. 
This assignment needs to be handin via canvas, no latter than Wensday the 20th of marts. 

## Rules
No collaborations is allowed. 
I want to test your knowledge and also give a guideline of which topics you need to study. 
It is okay if you do not solve all problems, the assignment has been designed this way. 
You are not allowed to skip forward unless the test specifically states it. 

## The purpose
The purpose of this setup, is to summarize your learning within Application Developement I/II. 
But the primary focus is on design and design patterns using C#. 
The test is not in any order, and will vary in complexity and time allocation. 
You can expect that each learning outcomes will be covered in this test, and more. 
So when you are done, you have covered the curriculum, with the exception of database design. 

This gives both of us the possibility to get a indication of where your knowledge is and what you need to focus on. 

## The goal
The goal is to test your knowledge, but also to give you a tool for cellection information og how-to solve specific problems. 

## The outcome
When you hav handed in the task, you have a small collections of cheatsheet and how to solve some basic problems. 

# Part 1 - Getting started
The first part is about just getting startted with everything and make sure that you have access. 
It is devided into two sub sections, fork and assign me as collaborator. 

## Fork repository
To get started, fork this repository into your own. 
This creates a copy of the repository and add it as one of yours. 
You are now able to manipulate the repository without disrupting me or your fellow students. 

## Assign me as collaborator
To give me a chance to provide concurrent feedback, assign me as the collaborator to the repository. 
This way you can tag me in comments, and ask question directly - I will then respond with either: 
1) You know this - research hard.
2) You should know this - look here.
3) I do not know what your are talking about, so I just provide an answer which I am satisfied with.

# Part 2 - Creating a branch
For this part you are required to create a new branch, where you can collect all the information, cheatsheet, advice, howto etc you collect. 
So a good advice, take notes on every step of the way, a note can be in the following form:
1) Diagram - visual representation of a concept. 
2) Flash card - two sided card with question on side A and asnwer on side B
3) Keyword - Write down keyword on a subject
4) Ask question - ask question about the subject

## Create a new branch named "toolbox". 
Create a new branch under the tab branch, and name i toolbox. 
In here you can collect your notes, and some specific C# implementation or other items you think is meaningfull.

## Add a new markdown file
Pull the branch to your local machine. 
Add new markdown file. 
1) Make some content for the file. 
2) perform action git add "filename.md"
3) perform action git status
4) Make a note on what you see.
5) perform action git commit -m "A meaningfull comment"
6) perform action git status
7) Make a note on what you see. 
8) perform the action git push
9) perform the action git status
8) Make you final note and draw a diagram of what is happening. 

Look up git cheatsheet and compare your diagram, with what the cheatsheet states. 
Make note on what is different and make an argument for why, and how. 

# Part 3 - Congratulations
Congratulations. 
You survived the first section. 

## Pull the next branch
Open the new branch Task2.
