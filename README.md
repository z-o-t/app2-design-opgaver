# Learning Outcome
Knowledge about used theory, common practice and method withn programming architecture, including technics and method within developing of applications. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this branch is to test your knowledge about the first learning outcome described above. You will be tested in your knowledge of theory and common practices within programming architecture. If you cannot answer these question write pass. 
## Goals
This branch gives you an indication of wether you have the required knowledge about application developement and thereby what you should focus on, if you do not know the answers. 

# Part 1 - Give a description of software lifecycle and different techniques for adhering to the lifecycle. 

# Part 2 - Outline and explain five common practices for technics and method when developing applications. 


# Software Lifecycle
    1. Idea generation / User Story
    2. Design, UML, Design Patterns etc.
    3. Develop the code
    4. Testing, debugging and QA
    5. Release and Maintenance


# 5 common practices

    1. Design patterns
        Resuable solutions to commons software development problems that has been proven effective over time
    2. Agile development
        Get feedback over time
    3. Version control with git
        Enables co-operation on code, and can fix code outside of the main
    4. Documentation
        Document what the code can do
    5. Code review
        Get other developers you know to look at your code for feedback
